EVERGLADES
----------
EVERGLADES is a synchronous, turn-based 1v1 strategy game originally developed by Lockheed Martin for reinforcement learning in real life combat situations. The primary objective of the game is to capture the opponentâ€™s base, and the secondary objective is capturing nodes and eliminating enemy opponents.

The primary goals as the Robot Behavior Analytics team:

- Characterize Everglades match output to determine behaviors that most often lead to wins
- Create AI scripts of targeted behaviors to test hypothesis from characterization activity
- Develop a real-time analytics engine that runs simultaneously with Everglades match playback

TYPICAL INSTALLATION
--------------------
Clone this repository with ``git``
::
  git clone https://github.com/shaunhyp57/everglades.git
  cd everglades

Dependencies
____________
EVERGLADES runs in a Python3 environment. Ensure the python packages ``gym`` and ``numpy`` are installed. This can be done with:
::
  pip install numpy
  pip install gym

If your computing environment requires it, make sure to include the --cert and --proxy flags with the pip commands.

Installation
____________
From the root Everglades directory, install the EVERGLADES environment with:
::
  pip install -e gym-everglades/

Next, install the Everglades server with:
::
  pip install -e everglades-server/

Finally, edit the ``test_battle.py`` script to reflect the current working environment. Update the following lines with their path in the file system:
-  agent 0 file
-  agent 1 file
-  config directory
-  output directory

File and Directory Descriptions
_______________________________

./agents/
+++++++++

This is a common directory where any created agents for the Everglades game can be stored. Some example files are included with the package.

./config/
+++++++++

This directory contains setup files which are used for game logic. Currently only the DemoMap.json and UnitDefinitions.json files are used for gameplay. They can be swapped for files defining a different map or units, but note that any swaps likely will cause inflexible server logic to break.

./everglades-server/
++++++++++++++++++++

This directory contains the main logic for the Everglades game.

./game_telemetry/
+++++++++++++++++

This is the default output directory for any match telemetry output. It is only populated locally and not stored in the git repository.

./gym-everglades/
+++++++++++++++++

This directory is the OpenAI Gym for project Everglades. It follows the Gym API standards.

./test_battle.py
++++++++++++++++

This is the script to execute for running two agents against each other.

./README.md
+++++++++++

This file, explaining important directory structure and installation requirements.

./.gitignore
++++++++++++

This file tells git to ignore compiled files and telemetry output.
