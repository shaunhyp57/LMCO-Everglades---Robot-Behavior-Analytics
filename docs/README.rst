EVERGLADES
----------
EVERGLADES is a synchronous, turn-based 1v1 strategy game originally developed by Lockheed Martin for reinforcement learning in real life combat situations. The primary objective of the game is to capture the opponentâ€™s base, and the secondary objective is capturing nodes and eliminating enemy opponents.

The primary goals as the Robot Behavior Analytics team:

- Characterize Everglades match output to determine behaviors that most often lead to wins
- Create AI scripts of targeted behaviors to test hypothesis from characterization activity
- Develop a real-time analytics engine that runs simultaneously with Everglades match playback
